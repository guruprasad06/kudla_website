      <h2>History Behind The name <span style="color: red">Mangaluru</span></h2>
      <p class="para">
        The name of the city, now officially Mangaluru, is primarily derived
        from the Hindu deity Mangaladevi, the presiding goddess of the historic
        Mangaladevi Temple located in the city. According to local legend: A
        princess named Premaladevi from Malabar became a disciple of the Nath
        sect founder, Matsyendranath, and was renamed Mangaladevi. She fell ill
        and passed away near the present-day temple site. The Mangaladevi Temple
        was consecrated in her honour, and the city was subsequently named after
        the temple. The original name in Kannada/Tulu, Mangalapura (meaning
        "auspicious city," with mangala meaning auspicious and pura meaning
        town/city) or Mangaluru (uru meaning town/city), was later anglicised to
        'Mangalore' during the British rule. The city's official name was
        restored to Mangaluru by the Karnataka government in 2014. It is also
        known as Kudla in Tulu (meaning "junction" due to the confluence of the
        Netravati and Gurupura rivers) and Kodial in Konkani.

      <h2 class="heading">Daiva Aradhana :</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Daiva Aradhane (Deity/Spirit Worship), also known as Bhuta Kola, is an
        ancient ritualistic practice of appeasing local guardian spirits (Bhutas
        or Daivas) unique to the Tulu-speaking region. The night-long ceremony
        involves a ritual specialist, known as the Patri or impersonator, who,
        after extensive preparation with dramatic makeup, heavy costumes, and
        ceremonial ornaments, enters a trance-like state believed to be a
        temporary possession by the spirit. During this possession, the Daiva
        delivers justice, provides prophecies, and offers blessings to the
        community, addressing their grievances and ensuring the land's
        prosperity. This profound socio-religious ritual is an integral part of
        the Tuluva social and spiritual governance, maintaining order and
        connecting the people with their ancestral protectors.

      <h2 class="heading">Kambula :</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Kambala is an annual, traditional buffalo race held in the slushy,
        water-filled paddy fields of coastal Karnataka, typically taking place
        between November and March. Originating as a festive event to mark the
        end of the harvesting season and to honor local deities for a good crop,
        the sport involves pairs of specially trained racing buffaloes being
        guided by a farmer (the runner) through a muddy track. The competition
        is a thrilling spectacle that showcases the deep bond between the
        farming community and their livestock, celebrated with massive crowds
        who gather to cheer on the racers. Modern Kambala has evolved into an
        organized sporting event with different categories, though it remains a
        powerful symbol of the region's agrarian heritage.

      <h2 class="heading">Pili Nalike :</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pili Nalike, or the Tiger Dance, is an energetic and ritualistic folk
        dance unique to Mangalore and the Tulu Nadu region, prominently
        performed during the Navaratri and Dasara festivities. Troupes of young
        men paint their bare bodies meticulously to resemble tigers, leopards,
        or cheetahs, a process that takes several hours. The performers then
        dance vigorously in the streets and in front of temples to the pulsating
        beats of the Thaase (percussion drums), exhibiting tremendous stamina
        and acrobatics, including fire breathing, handstands, and bending
        backward to pick up objects with their mouths. This dance is performed
        to honor Goddess Durga, whose favored animal is the tiger, and is a
        major highlight of the region's celebratory street processions.

      <h2 class="heading">Yakshagana :</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Yakshagana is a traditional, elaborate folk theatre form that is central
        to the culture of coastal Karnataka. Literally meaning "the song of the
        Yaksha (celestial beings)," this all-night performance art brilliantly
        combines dance, music, improvised dialogue, costume, and dramatic
        staging to narrate stories primarily drawn from Hindu epics like the
        Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The performers wear spectacular, vibrant
        costumes, intricate face paint, and towering headgear, embodying
        characters ranging from noble kings to powerful demons. The performance
        is guided by the Bhagavata (lead singer/narrator), who directs the play
        with singing and narration, accompanied by traditional percussion
        instruments like the Maddale and the Chande, creating a unique,
        electrifying theatrical experience.
